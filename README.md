# Choicer

Choicer is a RuneLite plugin that adds structured randomness and progression to item acquisition in Old School RuneScape.

This project is a **fork and substantial modification** of the original **ChanceMan** plugin by **ChunkyAtlas**, developed under the BSD 2-Clause License.  
The original concept, groundwork, and much of the underlying logic originate from that project and are credited accordingly.

## Project Background

The original **ChanceMan** plugin introduced a system where the **first drop of an item would unlock a single random item**.  
Choicer takes that foundation and deliberately changes the gameplay philosophy while preserving the proven technical core.

### Key differences from the original project:
- ❌ Removed single random unlocks  
- ✅ Introduced **multiple-choice unlock rolls**
- ✅ Retained core drop, loot, and persistence logic
- ✅ Expanded the item pool to include **untradeable items**
- ✅ Reworked UI and interaction flow

This fork exists to explore a **more player-driven and transparent progression model**, while staying within RuneLite and Jagex rules.

## Overview

**Choicer** separates item progression into two states:

- **Rolled** = unlocked/allowed to use
- **Obtained** = actually acquired in-game

An item is **usable only when it is both Rolled and Obtained**.

When an item is obtained for the first time, the plugin presents **multiple roll options** and lets the player choose one to unlock.  
Progress is tracked per character and persists across sessions and machines.
